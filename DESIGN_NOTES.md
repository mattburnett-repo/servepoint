### ðŸ”· **Top-Level Requirements**

#### 1. **Use Case: Social Services Case Management System**

* A flexible, scalable platform designed for managing **citizen cases** at both **federal and local government levels**.
* Core features:

  * Case intake via forms or APIs
  * Assignment, tracking, and status updates
  * Secure document upload and management
  * Staff communication and audit trails

#### 2. **Platform: Adobe ColdFusion 2021/2023**

* Utilizing modern ColdFusion features:

  * RESTful services and CFScript-first coding
  * CF-native schedulers, PDF/email tools
  * Secure session and authentication management

#### 3. **Architecture: HMVC via ColdBox Framework**

* Clear modular design with separation of concerns:

  * Handlers, models, views, interceptors
  * Built-in routing, AOP, caching, and logging
  * Highly testable and maintainable codebase

#### 4. **Data Layer: ColdFusion ORM**

* ORM-based data access using ColdFusionâ€™s Hibernate implementation:

  * Entity modeling with relationships and transaction safety
  * Portable schema design supporting future data evolution

#### 5. **System Integration: Deep, Demonstrable**

* Showcasing ColdFusionâ€™s integration capabilities:

  * Outbound API calls (mocked or live)
  * Document generation and emailing
  * Scheduled jobs for data sync or maintenance
  * Secure file upload and storage
  * Identity management via LDAP, OAuth, or SAML simulations

#### 6. **Frontend: Progressive Enhancement & Vue.js Ready**

* Initial UI with ColdFusion native templates
* Designed for easy integration with **Vue.js** frontend frameworks:

  * JSON/REST API endpoints
  * Responsive mobile-first design
  * **Legacy browser compatibility** (IE11+)
  * Progressive enhancement with polyfills and conservative JS

#### 7. **Testing: Integral from Inception**

* Full test coverage with **TestBox**:

  * Unit, integration, and behavioral tests
  * External dependencies mocked for reliable CI runs

#### 8. **Logging: Comprehensive Audit and Monitoring**

* Extensive logging via **LogBox**:

  * Authentication, authorization, CRUD, integration events
  * Admin actions and configuration changes
  * Multiple log targets for flexibility and future SIEM integration

#### 9. **Administrative Interface**

* Dedicated admin panel enabling:

  * User and role management with permission controls
  * System health and job monitoring
  * Manual background task triggers
  * Log and audit trail review
  * Configuration management with security considerations

#### 10. **Deployment: Containerized & Cloud-Ready**

* Full **Docker** support:

  * Dockerfiles and compose configs for easy local and cloud deployment
  * ColdFusion container images paired with DB and cache services
* Designed for seamless deployment to **cloud platforms** (AWS, GCP, or similar):

  * Support for container orchestration (ECS, Cloud Run, etc.)
  * Cloud-native logging and scaling considerations

#### 11. **User Privacy & Security**

* Adherence to **user privacy best practices**:

  * Minimal data collection and storage
  * Data encryption at rest and in transit (TLS)
  * Secure session management and cookie handling
  * Role-based access controls enforcing least privilege
  * Logging and monitoring designed to avoid exposing sensitive data
  * Compliance with relevant privacy regulations (GDPR, HIPAA, CCPA as applicable)

#### 12. **Best Practices**

* Secure coding following OWASP guidelines
* Modular, maintainable ColdBox conventions
* Dependency injection with WireBox
* Responsive, accessible, and maintainable UI

#### 13. **AI Assistance Permitted**

* Use of **ChatGPT** and **Cursor AI** for:

  * Boilerplate generation
  * Refactoring and documentation
  * Test creation and troubleshooting
